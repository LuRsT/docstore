RELEASE_TYPE: minor

If you use the new "actions" menu, there's an option to delete documents directly from the UI, which is something I've wanted for a while.

(As with calling the HTTP endpoint, this is only a "soft" delete -- the files are moved to a separate folder and disappear from the main view, but nothing is deleted from disk.)
