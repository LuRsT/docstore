RELEASE_TYPE: patch

This release adds Arial fonts to the base image, which can be substituted for Helvetica when creating thumbnails of PDFs that use Helvetica but don't include an embedded font.

This occurs in PDFs downloaded from [Workday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workday,_Inc.), the HR software we use at Welcome.
