RELEASE_TYPE: minor

This adds two flags for the GUI viewer:

*   `--tag_view=(cloud|list)` allows you to select a tag cloud-like view in "View Tags", which displays tags bigger if they're more common, rather than a flat list.

*   `--accent_color=#aabbcc` allows you to set an accent colour for the GUI style.  This isn't used much (yet), but gets rid of some of the blue!
