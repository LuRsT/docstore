# docstore

This is a small Python web app for managing my scanned documents.

I wanted a way to upload PDFs, add a few tags, then filter by those tags.
It includes small thumbnails to help me identify images.

It was a chance for me to play with [Responder](https://github.com/kennethreitz/responder) and newer versions of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) in a quick tool.
This is pretty slapdash code, written in a single evening as a fun exercise. :)
